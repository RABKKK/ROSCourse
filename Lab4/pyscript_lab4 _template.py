from sensor_read_class import ReadSensor
#from matplotlib import pyplot as plt#optional For ploting and visualizing data
#Additional libraries that may be used (try not use so many libraries) only what is required to ensure the program has minimum requirements

#Refer to Lab 2 and Lab 2 tasks to understand how objects are defined and Methods are called. 
#Also check the class defined in sensor_read_class.py file

#Step 0
#Set the range of data to be used
xyrange=[0, 1, -1, 1]



#Step 1
#Define the object
 

#Step 2
# Start loop to read data at each instant (for only a few iterations)

	#Step 3
	#Read sensor data

	#Step 4
	#Call the method to return data in the range of region of interest (roi)
	
	#Step 5
	#Calculate Mean by calling the method that caclulate mean for the region of interest (roi)

	#Step 6
	#Print the Mean value in a suitable format "Mean of the scan in the ROI is" in every iteration

#Optional
#Plot and show both the mean and the data in the regions of itnerest using suitable markers.
